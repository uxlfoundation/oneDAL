# oneAPI Data Analytics Library Message-Passing Interface Samples

Message-passing interface (MPI) samples for the oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) are designed to show how to use this library with the Intel(R) MPI library in a C++ application.

Unzip the archive with oneDAL samples to your working directory (`<sample_dir>`).

## System Requirements
The oneDAL includes distributed algorithms that can run on MPI-based cluster environments of Linux\* and Windows\* operating systems with the Intel(R) MPI library. For a list of oneDAL hardware and software requirements, refer to release notes for the version of oneDAL you are using.

## Preparation Before Build and Run
### MPI support
To link an application with the Intel(R) MPI library, do the following:

- On Windows\*:
    1. Add the following string to the include path: `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Intel\MPI\<ver>\intel64\include`, where `<ver>` is the directory for a particular MPI version;
    for example,`%ProgramFiles(x86)%\IntelSWTools\MPI\5.1.x.xxx\intel64\include`.
    2. Add the following string to the library path: `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\IntelSWTools\MPI\<ver>\intel64\lib`;
    for example, `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\IntelSWTools\MPI\5.1.x.xxx\intel64\lib`.
    3. Add `impi.lib` and `impicxx.lib` to your link command.
- On Linux\*, the Intel(R) MPI Library includes the `mpivars` scripts that you can run to set environment variables. You can find the `mpivars` scripts at `<MPI install-dir>/bin64/:
source mpivars.sh`

Check the documentation that comes with your MPI implementation for implementation-specific details of linking.

### Setting Up the Build Environment 
Before you build the sample, you must set certain environment variables that define the location of related libraries. oneDAL includes the `vars` scripts that you can run to set environment variables:

- On Windows\*, you can find the `vars.bat` batch file at `<install-dir>\compilers_and_libraries_xxxx.x.xxx\windows\daal\bin\:
vars.bat intel64`
- On Linux OS\*, you can find the `vars.sh` shell script at `<install-dir>\compilers_and_libraries_xxxx.x.xxx\linux\daal\bin\:
source vars.sh intel64`

For more information about setting environment variables and configuring oneDAL, refer to Getting Started guides for the library.

## Build and Run Instructions
### On Windows\*
To build oneDAL MPI C++ samples, go to the C++ MPI samples directory and execute the `launcher` command with the `build` parameter:

```
cd <sample_dir>\cpp\mpi

launcher.bat build
```

The command creates the `.\_results\intel64` directory and builds `*.exe` executables and `*.exe` libraries, as well as creates a log file for build results.

To run oneDAL MPI C++ samples, go to the C++ MPI samples directory and execute the `launcher` command with the `run` parameter:

```
cd <sample_dir>\cpp\mpi

launcher.bat run
```

For each sample, the results are placed into the `.\_results\intel64\<sample name>\.res` file.

### On Linux\*
To build oneDAL MPI C++ samples, go to the C++ MPI samples directory and execute the `make` command:

```
cd <sample_dir>/cpp/mpi

make {libintel64|sointel64} sample=<sample_name> mode=build
```

From the `{libintel64|sointel64}` parameters, select the one that has the prefix that matches the type of executables you want to build: `lib` for static and `so` for dynamic executables.

The names of the samples are available in the `daal.lst` file. If a sample name is not be provided, all samples are built.

The command creates a directory for the chosen library extension (`a` or `so`). For example: `_results/intel_intel64_a`.

To run oneDAL MPI C++ samples, go to the C++ MPI samples directory and execute the `make` command in the run mode. For example, if you run the `vars` script with the `intel64` target:

```
cd <sample_dir>/cpp/mpi 

make  libintel64 sample=svd_fast_distributed_mpi mode=run
```

The `make` command builds a static library for the Intel(R) 64 architecture and the `svd_fast_distributed_mpi.cpp` sample and runs the executable.
